It is illegal to remove this without  our permission, by doing so you are breaking various <strong>copyright laws</strong>. </p><p>Permission to use our templates for any purpose and without a fee is hereby granted,  provided that the our copyright notice stays intact. To legally remove our copyright you must pay the copyright license removal fee. Please click the below button for more information about how to remove our copyright notice. </p><a href="http://www.zymic.com/free-templates/copyright-removal/1135/" id="cr">Remove Copyright Notice</a><h2>Editing Pages</h2><p>The template pages are the files which end in .html, these pages contain all content and will be the main files you will be working with to customize your template. The .css files (such as style.css) contain code which may style certain elements of your template, such as the color of links, headers, backgrounds, images, alignments and much more. There will always be a file called index.html as this will be the home page of every template, it is advised to keep this named as index.html in order to let web browsers/servers know that this is the home page.</p><p>To edit each template page you must be able to edit HTML and CSS code. The best way to do this is to use a text-based application such as Microsoft Notepad and manually edit the code. If you have trouble understanding the code then we advise you to use a WYSIWYG editor such as Adobe Dreamweaver.</p><h2>Creating New Pages</h2><p>The best way to create new pages based on the template is to simply use the "File > Save As" feature of your editing application. This will duplicate the original page and will allow you to customize your new page in a matter of seconds.</p><h2>Blank Index</h2><p>There could well be a file named along the lines of "blank-index.html", this file is a clone of index.html (the home page of the template) however with all example content deleted. You can use this to get a head-start on your template and to save you time removing content you probably won't be needing.</p><h2>Editing Graphic/Image Files</h2><p>Each template will have various image editing formats to allow you to easily edit certain parts of the template. Please find the folder "Image Editing Files" enclosed in the .zip.</p><p>If the folder contains a .PSD file this is to be used with a program called Adobe Photoshop. Usually this will be a logo or header, open it up in Adobe Photoshop, edit the file and then re-save over the original image found in the "images/" folder. So for example if you have header.psd save that as header.jpg (or .gif/.png) in the "images/" folder to update your changes.</p><p>If the .PSD file is a full layout file you must make the changes you require in Adobe Photoshop and then go "File > Save For Web", and save as "image" in the template folder. index.html should now be edited with the changes you made in Adobe Photoshop.</p><p>If you do not have Adobe Photoshop there may be blank image files in the folder. These blank image files can be opened in your graphic editing program of choice and then re-saved over the original image(s) in the "images/" folder.</p><h2>Let Us Do The Customizing!</h2><p>If you are struggling or simply don't have the time to customize a template, let us do it for you!
